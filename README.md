# Pathfinder Core | A solution for your unit needs.
# DEPRECATED

Welcome:

**W**elcome to the Official Pathfinder Core Github page! Here you will find documentation about our creation, the Pathfinder MythicMobs system. 

**P**athfinder Core is a Plugin Configuration Pack for MythicMobs that lets you create mobs with a "unit" style. By that we mean, controllable mobs. You can give those mobs orders to follow, tasks to complete and targets to attack. Allowing your players to take full control of your units, you can let them make armies to clash against each other in epic battles where only the best commander will prevail.
